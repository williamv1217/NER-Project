# NLP Sentiment Analysis

We did analysis on various Named Entity Recognition libraries and how they performed on 3 different texts from various periods (one NY Times article, Moby Dick, and The Odyssey)

## Getting Started

This project uses jupyter notebooks and Python. The NLP libraries used are Spacy, Stanford NLTK, and Neural Coref for coreference resolution. 
Beautiful Soup 4 and Requests were  used for getting the NY Times article text.
